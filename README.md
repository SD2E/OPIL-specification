## Using LaTeX

### Building the PDF from LateX

To build, run these commands and check the output for errors. If there are errors, resolve them and re-run the failed build step before proceeding.

    pdflatex opil
    bibtex opil
    pdflatex opil
    pdflatex opil

Note that pdflatex is run several times. Each successive pass mows down unresolved references from the previous passes. For example, the extra pdflatex commands set references correctly after bibtex completes. You donâ€™t need to do this in every build unless the bibliography has changed.  For development purposes, you may just need to run pdflatex once.
